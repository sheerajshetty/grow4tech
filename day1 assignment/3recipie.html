        <ul>
            <li>1/2 kgChicken </li>
            <li>250gram kg rice</li>
            <li>20gram Ginger and Garlic paste</li>

        <h3>METHODS</h3>
         <P>In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.
            Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Cook until the onions are softened and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
            Add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, bay leaf, cinnamon sticks, and cardamoms. Cook for 1 minute more.
            Add the marinated chicken to the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is browned on all sides.
            Add the rice and stir to coat with the spices.
            Add enough water to cover the rice by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through.
            Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

        <img height="300" width="500" src="russgulla.jpg" alt="biriyani photo">
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cups sugar</li>
            <li>6 cups water ect..</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>METHODS</h3>
         <p>Bring the milk to a boil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.
            Once boiling, add the lemon juice or vinegar gradually, stirring constantly until the milk curdles and separates into whey and chenna (milk solids).Turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.
            Line a strainer with a muslin cloth and place it over a bowl. Pour the curdled milk into the strainer.
            Gather the edges of the muslin cloth and squeeze out as much whey as possible. Do not over-squeeze, as it can make the rasgullas tough.
            Rinse the chenna under cold running water to remove any traces of lemon juice.</p>
